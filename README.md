# ToDoList

##Goal
I created this project to learn Spring Boot. This is my first individual project using web technologies in Java.
I would like first to focus on the backend side, so create the REST API, coverage my code with unit tests, use swagger. 
Then I can try to build also the frontend page.

##Technologies
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data
- JUnit

In the future:
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf

##Roadmap
- [ ] Create REST API
- [ ] Build frontend for regular users
- [ ] Publish project in internet

# ToDoList

## General Information
I created this project to learn Spring Boot. This is my first individual project using web technologies in Java.
I would like first to focus on the backend side, so create the REST API, coverage my code with unit tests, use swagger. 
Then I can try to build also the frontend page.

## Technologies Used
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data
- JUnit

In the future:
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf

## Features
- Add ToDoItem
- Update ToDoItme
- Delet ToDoItem
- Get ToDoItems

## Project Status
Project is: _paused_
The project was discontinued in favor of other projects: [Vacation Manager](https://github.com/Kryhowsky/vacationmanager), [Shop](https://github.com/Kryhowsky/shop).

## Room for Improvement
To do:
- [ ] Create REST API
- [ ] Build frontend for regular users
- [ ] Publish project on internet
